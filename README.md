ASWF [Rez](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/rez) package recipes primarily targeting Arch Linux.

The general philosophy is to allow other package systems (e.g.: pacman, Autodesk Access, Houdini Launcher) to manage installation and versioning through _native Rez packages, while environment variables and non-packaged software are managed through Rez.
